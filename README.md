## Inspirations

Every year, millions of lives are at risk due to diagnostic errors, accounting for about 10% of all patient deaths worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that these errors contribute to millions of cases of harm annually and up to **2.6 million** deaths in low- and middle-income countries. In developing regions, where access to experienced **healthcare professionals** is limited, these issues are even more pronounced. The loss or misplacement of lab reports can exacerbate these challenges, turning a difficult situation into a life-threatening one.

**Our project is inspired by the real-life challenges faced by many in countries like Bangladesh.** For example, a relative needing regular follow-up care lived far from her specialist in Dhaka. The cost and inconvenience of travel made it nearly impossible for her to receive necessary care, leading to a deterioration in her condition. Many patients face similar obstacles, often traveling long distances or to other countries for advanced treatments, only to find follow-up care prohibitively expensive or logistically unfeasible. This results in neglected medication management, severe complications, and avoidable deaths.

To address these issues, we envisioned a platform designed to make **healthcare more accessible, reliable, and effective**. Our solution securely stores medical reports, provides real-time access, and utilizes clear **graphical analysis**, various metrics, and raw images. This approach enables doctors to view and discuss reports during video consultations, facilitating accurate and comprehensive evaluations without the need for costly and time-consuming travel.


## What It Does

**Our platform revolutionizes healthcare management by offering a seamless and efficient approach to processing medical reports and facilitating consultations. Key features include:**

### Effortless Report Processing and Visualization

- **<u>Automatic Data Extraction</u>**: Upload a medical report image, and our technology extracts and organizes key details—test names, sample information, and dates—accurately and clearly.
- **<u>Advanced Data Organization</u>**: Data is structured into an intuitive format, ensuring easy access and clear presentation.
- **<u>Innovative Visualization</u>**: Data is transformed into interactive graphs, detailed metrics, and tables, providing a clear and actionable view of medical information.

### AI-Powered Recommendations

- **<u>Symptom-Based Recommendations</u>**: Describe symptoms during appointment booking, and our AI system suggests the most suitable medical specialty, ensuring you see the right specialist.

### Real-Time Consultation

- **<u>Video Consultations</u>**: During video calls, patients and doctors can access and discuss visualized data in real time, facilitating quick and informed decision-making.

### Secure and Continuous Tracking

- **<u>Secure Storage</u>**: Reports are securely stored and tracked, preventing loss and ensuring reliable access to historical data.

### Global Connectivity and Accessibility

- **<u>Worldwide Access</u>**: Connect with specialists globally through video consultations, bridging geographical gaps and making expert medical advice accessible to those in remote or underserved areas.

## How We Built It

**We used advanced technologies to streamline medical report processing and consultations:**

- **Data Processing and Structuring**: *Implemented OCR with Asprise OCR API for data extraction and organization. Converted text into a detailed JSON format with keys for descriptions, results, reference ranges, and units. Applied NLP using Google Gemini API for data cleaning and structuring.*

- **Doctor Recommendation System**: *Developed an NLP-based system using NLTK and scikit-learn to recommend doctors based on symptoms, employing text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, and logistic regression.*
- **Dynamic Graphs and Metrics**: *Created interactive graphs and metrics using JavaScript. Designed a responsive interface with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django’s templating engine.*
- **Real-Time Video Chat**: *Integrated ZEGOCLOUD’s video call functionality with ZegoUIKitPrebuilt for seamless virtual consultations.*
- **Comprehensive Integration**: *Combined technologies like Asprise OCR, Google Gemini, and ZEGOCLOUD with Django and scikit-learn to build a cohesive system.*

## Challenges We Ran Into

1. **OCR Technology Implementation**: Faced difficulties with accuracy and compatibility of various OCR solutions. Resolved by choosing Asprise OCR API, which provided the necessary precision.
2. **Video Chat Integration**: Encountered challenges with Zoom’s API documentation and authentication. Successfully integrated ZEGOCLOUD’s video call functionality as an alternative.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- Achieved an OCR accuracy rate exceeding 96%, demonstrating effective data extraction.
- Integrated real-time video functionality with seamless report viewing, enhancing user interaction.
- Accurately represented and analyzed medical data in a clear, intuitive manner, showcasing our commitment to high-quality, actionable insights.

## What We Learned

- Expanded knowledge in integrating APIs, including OCR technology and video chat functionalities.
- Gained insights into NLP using NLTK and Google Cloud Vision for text data processing and analysis.
- Enhanced project management and team coordination skills, showcasing the impact of advanced technology solutions in real-world applications.

## What's Next

We plan to advance our platform with the following innovations:

- **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Develop AI models for diagnosing diseases such as breast cancer, pneumonia, dengue, and leukemia using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Integrate with Google Cloud Healthcare API and Microsoft Azure Health Bot for precise diagnostics.
- **2D to 3D X-Ray Transformation**: Use technologies like NVIDIA Clara and 3D Slicer to convert 2D X-ray images into 3D models for more detailed insights.
- **Seamless Hospital Integration**: Implement direct integration with hospitals via RESTful APIs and FHIR standards for real-time data exchange, reducing paper usage and costs.
- **Environmental and Practical Benefits**: Promote sustainability and cost savings by reducing paper reliance and centralizing medical data for improved efficiency.
